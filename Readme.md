# Everything about collisions

educational simulation and collection of all well known and important collision algorithms including the AABB, SAT, GJK, Pixel Perfect, Particle.

I hope to provide a reference and resource for those learning or developing programs using these algorthms or wanting to understand the underlyingmath


## Article
the accomanying article for this repo can be found here 
it contains underlying math, images of important contextualizations for the algorithms, explanations of how to use the simulation and the algorithms themselves, and sources for independent research.
