    <H1> Algorithms</H1>
    <p>a piece of math that I think is extremely underappreciated is the math behind collision algorithms.
    In the places where these algorithms are used the most(being computer graphics and game engines) many tools just automatically handle the physics logic and the user is uninformed 
    about the underlying math.
    
    <hr>
    but as more and more people start learning about the math for the sake of self made graphics or game engines, it's important to have a simple start off to research of a complex topic.


    the goal of the article is to provide is a collection of common algorithms used to simulate the physics of two objects colliding accompanied by images from self built simulation as well as 
    mathmatical explanation for how they work. Hopefully, this helps some people understand what algorithms are available before they go into the more in depth topics of optimization
    which are also mentioned below along with sources i've found on the topic that are hopefully good.

    <h2> AABB(Axis Alligned Bounding Box)</h2>
    
    <p> this algorithm is the most simple but also has applications to larger scale systems in collision optimization in the form of AABB trees

        the algorithm just states that if two non rotated rectangles have an overlap on the x and y Axis then those two boxes are colliding and the collision needs to be resolved.

        logically this makes sense
