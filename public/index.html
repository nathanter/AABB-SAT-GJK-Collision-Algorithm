    if I throw a ball at a wall, we know the collision makes the ball bounce back. But these collisions don't just occur in real life, they also occur in computer simulations.
    but we can't just tell the computer, if I walk into a wall make me bounce back, so how do collisions actually work?

        the math behind simulating physics collisions in computer graphics is very interesting and nifty piece of math that I think is extremely underappreciated
        In the places where these algorithms are used the most(being computer graphics and game engines) many tools just automatically handle the physics logic and the user is uninformed 
        about the underlying math.

        but as more and more people start learning about the math for the sake of self made graphics or game engines,I want to try and help others in their research by providing a simple start off point.

        the goal of the article is to provide is a collection of common algorithms used to simulate the physics of two objects colliding accompanied by images from self built simulation as well as 
        mathmatical explanation for how they work. Hopefully, this helps some people understand what algorithms are available before they go into the more in depth topics of optimization
        which are also mentioned below along with sources i've found on the topic that are hopefully good.

    <h2> AABB(Axis Alligned Bounding Box)</h2>
    
    <p> this algorithm is the most simple but also has applications to larger scale systems in collision optimization in the form of AABB trees(talked on later)</p>
        <p>
        but first, what is an AABB?

        </p>
        the algorithm just states that if two non rotated rectangles have an overlap on the x and y Axis then those two boxes are colliding and the collision needs to be resolved.

        logically this makes sense
